## What is copywriting

Copywriting is the ability to write persuasive text, words that sell. Good copy is the text that converts a visitor into a lead, and a lead into a customer.

## 4 steps to write email that convert

For your email to be able to convert, they must match 4 primary steps:
- Must get delivered: if our email isn't delivered, then it's useless.
- Must get seen: if our email isn't seen (spam folder), then it's useless.
- Must get read: if our email isn't read, then it's useless as well.
- Must get clicked: the goal of our email is to get our lead to click a link to send them to our website.

## Anatomy of an email

An email is composed of the following elements:
- Subject line: Grabs the reader's attention.
- Opening Sentence: Get the reader curious, draw them in.
- Story: A short story to connect with the reader.
- Lesson "learned": Something you learned thanks to the story.
- Call to action: Get the reader to click.

Not all emails will be identical, it's important to juggle between different types of emails, but make sure they follow a logical chain.
- Story
- Checklist
