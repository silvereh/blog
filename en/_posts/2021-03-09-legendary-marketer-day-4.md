The [Legendary Marketer][1] is an online programme designed to teach you all you need to know to be able to grow an online business from nothing.
In this lesson, after a week of waiting to meet my business advisor, I'm learning about mindset and how it can affect one's ability to succeed.

## Mindset is taught young

The first seven years of a child's life dictate how they will grow as a person. That is the period when our brain is most malleable and develop our way of thinking. If we live in a poor family, we learn how a poor person lives... In contrast, if we live in a rich family, we learn the mindset and habits of a rich person.

## Schools teach people to be poor

The school system is designed to keep people in the poor people mindset. We are taught to learn skills that are useful for the rich people to exploit. But the important subjects like money and how it works are not taught in schools, because the rich want to keep these skills for themselves so they can remain in a dominating position.

### Specialization in education

Specialization is a tool that allows the rich to keep control of the rest of the population. Indeed, once poor people have invested a lot in an expensive specialized education, it is more difficult for them to make a step toward financial education, they prefer staying in their comfort bubble.
