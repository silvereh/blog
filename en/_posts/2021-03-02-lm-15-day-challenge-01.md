## Starting the Challenge

Today, after several weeks of seeing people advertise the 15 days challenge from the Legendary Marketer on TikTok, I finally decided to make the first step and invest a whoping $7.00 into this program. I will try to document my journey on this blog and invite you all to follow me on my journey to building an online business and to financial freedom. 

## Lesson 1: The Sales Funnel

A sales funnel is a website specifically designed to make sales. Sales funnels are comprised of a few different elements, each with its own role:

### Lead Capture Page

In this very first page, we will collect the email of potential customers to build an **email list**. We will often offer a free gift AKA **Lead Magnet** (like a one or two page pdf for example) in exchange for this email address. This email is very important for this model since it's the method we are going to use to advertise our products to our potential customers and convert them from **leads** to **customers**.

### Sales Page

In this second page, we are going to present our product with a compelling video encouraging our lead to buy our product. It's essential that this page stays distraction free and confusion free. The goal here is to sell our basic low ticket product. To accomplish this goal, there will only be a single button on this page.

### Upsell Page

In this page, we are proposing additional products to our new customer to increase our profits. It can be a discount on a bigger quantity, additional related products to the initial product we sell, etc...

## Lesson 2: The Value Ladder

This concept represents the entire business model. We use the sales funnel to catch our customers by selling them low ticket products. Then, further down the line, we will be able to gain their trust and sell them our higher ticket items, those on which we will make the real money.

Note: I will add a link to the program later on, once I have a better understanding of it and its value. Follow for more updates.
