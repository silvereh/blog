## Why is sales important

Many of you will complain saying "but I'm not a sales person", I was the same... The truth is, saying I was not a sales person is one of the things that impaired me the most in my life.
Let's assume you're looking for a job and get an interview, then you're doing sales. It doesn't look like sales because you're not selling a product, but you're selling something far more important than a product, you're selling your skills, your experience, your knowledge...
Each time you have an argument with someone and try to get them to agree with you, you're selling your opinion on the subject. On the grand scheme of things, each time you have interaction with someone else, you're selling yourself to them.
That's why sales is such an important skill to have.

## Structure of a good sales pitch

A good sales pitch contains 3 essential parts:
- Tease: Appeal to your audience by talking about their problems.
- Please: Solve that problem for them.
- Seize: Make an irresistible offer so they buy from you.
