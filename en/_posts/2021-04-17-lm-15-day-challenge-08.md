## What is a high income skill?

A high income skill is a skill that you can leverage to make a lot of money, plain and simple.

## What we learn in school.

A lot of the skills we learn at school are not useful in the real world, in the workplace. For example, test-taking is a major skill for a student, but once we are no longer on the school benches, we no longer use that skill. It is the same with other skills such as trigonometry, physics, etc... Those skills are only relevant for a very small amount of careers but are absolutely irrelevant for others, and yet students are forced to learn those skills to be able to determine the career they want to develop.

## Some skills we learn later on that are not high income.

- Social Media scrolling: We waste hours scrolling through social media, watching cute videos and commenting on family's irrelevant posts.
- Video Games: Unless we are streaming, have thousands or millions of followers, and are getting paid for it, video game skills don't make us a dime.
- Learning: Being a learner is great, but unless we actually take action and apply the new skills we learned, that knowledge is wasted... I feel I have fallen into this tarpit myself where I attend dozens of webinars each month, yet, as I have not yet taken action on them, I remain unsuccessful in my business.
