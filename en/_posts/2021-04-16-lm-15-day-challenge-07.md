## Do you like your current job?

First thing to take in consideration when thinking about transitioning is whether you like your day-job. If you do, it's probably a better idea to keep your day-job and grow your own business on the side until it's grown enough.

## What do you need to be safe quitting your day-job?

Consider your expenses, what would happen if you quit your day-job? Would you be able to survive? Would you be able to live? Would you be able to keep paying your monthly expenses, and still have money left to continue growing? If you didn't make any money at all for 1 year, would you still be able to keep on living?
If the answer to all these questions is *yes*, then you are safe to quit.
