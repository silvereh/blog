## What is a lead

No matter what business you're in, you need leads to make business, it's the first step that leads a person from being a visitor, to being a customer. When a visitor gives you their email address, they are telling you that they are interested in what you have to offer, they become a potential customer.

## Identify your target audience

First step in generating leads is to properly target your audience. You must have a clear and precise idea of who your ideal customer is, what are their problems... Once you've identified your customer, you can give them a solution to their problems. Most people are afraid to target precisely their audience, thinking they will leave money on the table, but in reality, a more targeted audience generates better leads.

## How to generate high quality leads

Not all leads are equal. Some leads have a better chance to convert. Interestingly though, the quality of your leads is directly connected to how you generate that lead, rather than who that lead is. To generate higher quality leads, it's important to create a connection with your audience, understand their pain points, help them solve their problems... This will build authority and trust, which will then increase your chances of conversion.
