## Wantrepreneur, when you don't want it bad enough

The number one reason of failure in the entrepreneurship world is the lack of commitment. If you don't want to be successful with every fiber of your soul, you will find excuses to not commit to your goals, and you will fail. It's important to set goals and make a plan to succeed because failing to plan is planning to fail. It helps to set monthly, quarterly, and yearly goals. Once your goals are set, commit to them and don't give yourself excuses.
