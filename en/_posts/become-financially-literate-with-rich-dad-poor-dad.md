One of the key things to understand to become rich is money and how it works. I started reading [Robert Kiyosaki's *Rich Dad, Poor Dad*][1] about a month ago and it raised my financial awareness to levels I didn't even begin to imagine. I will try to write about my progression toward financial awareness and literacy over the next few weeks.
