## The key to the success of any business: OPM

OPM (other people's money AKA debt) is the main starter of any business. Successful entrepreneurs understand that they need to pour money into their business one way or another, and if you don't have the funds for your business, that means taking a loan to get started.

## Business expenses

A business expense is any money you have to spend to run your business, this includes but is not limited to training, attending seminars, having a lunch with a prospective client, etc... Business expenses can be deducted from your taxes, thus lowering the amount of taxes you pay.
